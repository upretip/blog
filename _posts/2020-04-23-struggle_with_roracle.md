# Struggle Installing ROracle

I recently changed teams which meant using new tools to do the job. In this team, we heavily use Oracle databases for all our database needs.
Oracle databases power our application databases, Business Intelligence back ends, and even data warehouses. My team provides data warehouse 
to the rest of the business and sometimes we use the data warehouses ourselves to get some analytics.

While I do not use R regularly for what I do now, I find myself using R to do some data manupulation and analytics. R is what I know the best 
and can easily do a lot of data wrangling, plotting and data analytics. In my previous experiences, I have had opportunities to 
work with other database systems mainly, MySQL, PostgreSQL, sqlite3 and Amazon Redshift among many others. I used to use `rodbc` 
to interface with the databases then.
